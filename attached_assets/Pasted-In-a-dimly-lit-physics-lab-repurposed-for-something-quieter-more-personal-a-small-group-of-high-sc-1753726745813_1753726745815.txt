In a dimly lit physics lab repurposed for something quieter, more personal, a small group of high school boys sat around a table covered in wires, batteries, resistors, and lumps of modeling clay. The usual problem sets had been replaced by a different kind of circuit diagram. One that mapped pressure, loss, and burnout across the fragile architecture of the teenage psyche. This was the first session of Grief Circuits, an initiative I founded to help male students articulate emotional experiences through the familiar language of systems, models, and physical logic.

Attendance began modestly; six students, quiet, guarded. We started by examining voltage drops as a metaphor for emotional depletion. We built circuits where broken paths could be repaired with conductive clay, modeling the idea that healing doesn’t mean restoring the original circuit but redesigning it for resilience. Journaling exercises tracked the current of daily emotional flow. Stress became resistance. Support became parallel pathways.

Over time, the room filled. Friends brought friends. Students who wouldn’t normally enter a counselor’s office found permission here to reflect logically, spatially, privately. By spring, over a hundred students from across campus had joined at least one session. The language began to spread. Boys who hadn’t spoken to each other before were discussing how they were rebuilding their base nodes or adding capacitors after exams.

Our final session of the year had standing room only. More than one hundred students showed up. Some brought journals they had kept throughout the term. Others just came to listen. The models on the table weren’t perfect replicas of any known circuit, but they made sense to those who had built them. That was the point.

Now the program is scaling.

This September, my school’s annual STEM Olympiad will include a new segment. One dedicated to Grief Circuits and the broader idea of systems-based emotional education. Workshops will be open to visiting students from across Lahore. The goal is not therapeutic catharsis. It is structural literacy. If boys can understand pressure in pipes and signal loss in wires, they can begin to map those same principles onto internal states without shame or abstraction.

We don’t need to dismantle stoicism. We just need to reframe it in terms they already respect. The circuits are already in place. They just need better routing.
